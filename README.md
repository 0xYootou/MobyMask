# Delegatable Eth 

An abstract solidity contract that any contract can easily integrate to add a ton of improvements to that contract's user and developer experience for all of its functions:
- Allow users to sign "invocations" instead of transactions, which bring lots of benefits.
- Support for MetaTransactions
- Support for batched operations 
- Support for signing multiple actions that aren't blocked by each other
- Support for signing commitments that can be lazily submitted to the blockchain later
- Allow users to sign offchain messages that delegate authority to perform any action they can perform, along with an open-ended system for adding restrictions to that delegation, including revocation.
- Allow the holder of any delegation to issue a delegation from it, also with an off-chain signature and no up-front gas.
- Allows creating invite links to users who don't have accounts set up yet, by signing delegations to a key you send to them.

You can read about [the theory behind this library here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/capabul/page/cnW_23H8w).

## Integration in a Solidity project

Not that this is far enough along to really use yet, but the intention is that you will:

- inherit your contract from [contracts/Delegatable.sol](./packages/hardhat/contracts/Delegatable.sol).
- Use the msgSender() "standard" trick: Never call `msg.sender` directly to enforce policy, always call the internal private method `_msgSender()`, so that metaTransactions and other parts of code can assign a custom sender. [Examples here](https://github.com/anydotcrypto/metatransactions).
- If you are inheriting from multiple contracts that implement `_msgSender`, you may need to implement your own override method as shown in `contracts/YourContract.sol`.

## How it's set up

A fork of Scaffold-ETH boilerplate

Currently most of the good stuff is going on in `packages/hardhat`.

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
